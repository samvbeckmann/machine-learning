# Machine Learning

This repository contains projects for my machine learning class, taken in the Spring of 2017 under Dr. Sandip Sen.

## Project 1: Clustering
The first project invlolves algorithms for unsupervised clustering. For this project, I implemented two algorithms: K-Means and EM (Expectation Maximization).
